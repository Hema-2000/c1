/*program to calculate area and circumference of the circle*/
#include <stdio.h>  //header file

     int rad;  //declaration of radius
     float pi=3.14,cir,area;  //initialization of constant pi & declaration of circumference and area
     printf("enter the value of rad: ");  //our console is to enter the value of radius
     scanf("%d",&rad);  //reading the value of radius
     area=pi*rad*rad;  //calculation of area
     printf("area of the circle:%f\n",area);  //area of circle is obtained by the above formula
     cir=2*pi*rad;  //calculation of circumference
     printf("circumference of the circle:%f",cir);  //circumference of circle is obtained by the above formula

output:
enter the value of rad: 4
area of the circle:50.240002
circumference of the circle:25.120001
